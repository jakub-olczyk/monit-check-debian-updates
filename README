# monit-check-debian-updates

A script for monit monitoring daemon that checks for updates in distros using
APT

This is inspired by the Nagios Plugin check_debian_packages

The logic of this solution relies on the fact that monit can check the status
of programs it executes and later use that for resolving the problems reported
